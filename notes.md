  * Convert to Swift, just covering var arrays don't cover `let` at all
  * This reading isn't suuuuper narrative-y. Doesn't show the why before the
    what. We should change that
  * Only explain the literal syntax
  * Explain adding to arrays, removing, no iteration
  * Explain access at index
  * Explain you can put multiple data types into arrays, but it's not good
